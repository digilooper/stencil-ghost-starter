Either customise your existing theme, or create a new theme from scratch with our <a href=\"https://ghost.org/docs/themes/\">Theme SDK</a>. </p><p>You can integrate <em>any</em> front end code into a Ghost theme without restriction, and it will work just fine. No restrictions!</p><p><strong>Here are some common examples</strong>:</p><ul><li>Include comments on a Ghost blog with <a href=\"https://ghost.org/integrations/disqus/\">Disqus</a> or <a href=\"https://ghost.org/integrations/discourse/\">Discourse</a></li><li>Implement <a href=\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\">MathJAX</a> with a little bit of JavaScript</li><li>Add syntax highlighting to your code snippets using <a href=\"https://prismjs.com/\">Prism.js</a></li><li>Integrate any dynamic forms from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/forms/\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">Typeform</a> to capture data</li><li>Just about anything which uses JavaScript, APIs and Markup.</li></ul><h1 id=\"using-the-public-api\">Using the Public API</h1><p>Ghost itself is driven by a set of core APIs, and so you can access the Public Ghost JSON API from external webpages or applications in order to pull data and display it in other places.</p><blockquote>The Ghost API is <a href=\"https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/\">thoroughly documented</a> and straightforward to work with for developers of almost any level. </blockquote><p>Alright, the last post in our welcome-series!
